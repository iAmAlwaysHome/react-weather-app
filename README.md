# Description
The Weather web app was created to practice React and API usage. To make my weather dashboard to look different and interesting weather data is displayed isometrically to give user a 3D feel. In the future I may add the animated word cloud with city names to click to display the weather and make the forecast cells clickable.<br><br>

# Key features

- Users can input city manually or allow app to locate them.
- The temperature can be displayed in either F or C.
- Uses OpenWeather and Geolocation API data.
